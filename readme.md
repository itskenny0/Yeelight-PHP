## Yeelight-PHP

This is a tiny class to facilitate controlling the Yeelight WiFi bulbs by Xiaomi in PHP.

Function names are dynamic and respond to the API endpoints found in the : [Xiaomi docs](https://www.yeelight.com/download/Yeelight_Inter-Operation_Spec.pdf).

No Composer or other crap - keep it minimal.
This script has no external dependencies other than some PHP 5.x version and the sockets extension.

Usage:

    <?php
    require "Yeelight.class.php";
    
    $yee = new Yeelight("10.0.0.201", 55443);
    
    $yee->set_power("on"); // power on
    $yee->set_rgb(0xFF0000); // color to red
    $yee->set_bright(50); // brightness to 50%
    
    $yee->commit(); // changes are not sent to the bulb before commit() is called
    
    sleep(10);
    $yee->set_rgb(0x00FF00)->set_bright(100)->commit(); // calls return the object for fast chaining of commands
    
    $status = $yee->get_prop("power")->commit(); // get current status
    print_r($status);
    
    $yee->disconnect();
